# String Manipulation

This is an example of a test I was given during an interview.

## Question

Given a string and an optional count value, can you process the input string
and output a single (unless defined) character for each of the characters
in the input string.

### Example

* "AASDEDFFRDSSSSEDSW" using the default count of 1, should return "ASDEDFRDSEDSW"
* "AAAASDEEEERFFDRETYTGGFDDD" using a count of 2, should return "AASDEERFFDRETYTGGFDD"
* "AAAASDEEEERFFDRETYTGGFDDD" using a count of 3, should return "AAASDEEERFFDRETYTGGFDDD"

## Attempts

I've made two attempt so far.  They are not elegant, and could be improved.

My next attempt will try to use linq.  As I have the unit tests working properly, I can attempt to see how it works.
